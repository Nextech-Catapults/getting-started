Welcome Catapults! Weather your journey of learning to code is just beginning here or you are already well on your way, we're glad you are here and we know there is a lot to learn!

We're going to start by setting up the tools you will use throughout the summer, VS Code and GitHub. These have both been carefully selected as approachable tools that are important to know - people use these every day in coding careers!

## Prerequisites

Here's what you'll need to get started
- A GitHub account (free): https://github.com/join  
- A Windows PC (Windows 10 or 11) or Mac (macOS 10.15+)

## 1. Install VS Code

### Windows

1. Go to the VS Code download page for Windows:  
   https://code.visualstudio.com/download   
2. Under **Windows**, click **User Installer** (x64 or Arm64) to download the `.exe`.   
3. Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts: accept the license, choose an install location, and allow creating a desktop icon. 

### macOS

1. Go to the VS Code setup page for macOS:  
   https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac  
2. Click **Download for macOS**, open the `.zip` or `.dmg`, then drag **Visual Studio Code.app** into your **Applications** folder.  
3. Launch VS Code from **Launchpad** or **Spotlight**.

## 2. Connect Your GitHub Account

1. Open VS Code.  
2. In the **Activity Bar** (left sidebar), click the **Accounts** icon (a person silhouette).  
3. Choose **Sign in with GitHub**, which opens your browser.
4. Authorize VS Code to access your GitHub account. When prompted, click **Authorize** and return to VS Code. 

> **Tip:** If you ever need to re-authenticate, click the Accounts icon again and choose **Sign out**, then **Sign in with GitHub**.

## 3. Fork & Clone the Repository

### Fork on GitHub

1. In your browser, navigate to this lesson’s repo on GitHub.  
2. Click the **Fork** button (top right). This creates a copy under your GitHub account.

### Clone in VS Code

1. Back in VS Code, click the **Source Control** icon (Git icon) in the Activity Bar.  
2. Click **Clone Repository** (or **…** → **Clone**). 
3. Select the **GitHub.com** tab, find your fork (it appears under your account), and click on it.  
4. Choose a local folder where you’d like to store the project, then click **Select Repository Location**. VS Code will download and open it.

## 4. Edit `AboutMe.md`

This is a Markdown file! What's going on here is not super important and this type of file we won't spend too much time on. This is just a way for us to get to know you and for you to get to know your new tools. 

1. In VS Code’s **Explorer** (first icon in the Activity Bar), open **AboutMe.md**.  
2. Fill out the file with some information about yourself! Replace anything inside double stars, for example `**YOUR NAME HERE**` should be `**Jane**`. In Markdown, anything in stars will be bold.   
3. Check a box in the list with a star, like this `[*]`
4. Optional: Add more info, feel free to make this your own. If you want to learn more about Markdown, do some Googling or try asking ChatGPT what it can do! 
5. Save your edits with **File → Save** or **Ctrl+S** (Windows) / **⌘+S** (macOS).

## 5. Commit & Push Your Changes

1. Click the **Source Control** icon. You’ll see your changed `AboutMe.md` listed under **Changes**.  
2. Stage your changes by clicking the **+** next to `AboutMe.md` (or the **Stage All Changes** button). 
3. In the **Message** box at the top, type a commit message like “Update about me” and press **Ctrl+Enter** (Windows) / **⌘+Enter** (macOS) to commit.
4. Click the **…** menu above and select **Push** (or click the cloud with an up‑arrow icon). Your commit is now on the **main** branch of your fork on GitHub.
