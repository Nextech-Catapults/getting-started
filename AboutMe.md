# 🎯 Welcome to Nextech Catapults Mad Libs! 🚀

Hi, my name is **YOUR NAME HERE** and I'm a student at **YOUR SCHOOL NAME HERE**.

This summer during my time with Nextech Catapults I'm learning to code, and I feel:
- [ ] Like a coding wizard in training 🧙‍♂️
- [ ] Ready to break the internet (in a good way) 💥
- [ ] Slightly terrified, but excited 😅
- [ ] Like I have no idea what I’m doing… yet! 🤔

## My Mad Skills (or soon-to-be skills)

So far, I know how to:
- {{ Add something you're good at – this can be anything! (e.g. solving puzzles, drawing, fixing things) }}

I want to learn how to:
- {{ Add something you want to learn – it can be related to tech, or not! }}

## My Personal Fun Facts 🧠

- My favorite snack while coding: **Your snack of choice**
- One thing I *definitely* want to do this summer: **Dream big!**
